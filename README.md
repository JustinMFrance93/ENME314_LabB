Lab B: Dimensional Analysis and Boundary Layer concept  
Author Justin France

This assignment exposes you to some of the techniques routinely used by engineers to tackle practical 
problems. These include modelling a problem using dimensional analysis to allow the use of scale 
models and using experiment to obtain a qualitative description of the phenomena involved and 
relevant results. 

This Lab will use stationary spheres in a wind tunnel where the force on on the 20MM sphere them is too 
small to measure.Instead for the experiments larger spheres will be used where the principles of similarity,
and dimensionless numbers will be used to obtain the values for the 20mm lead sphere. caculations was coded
in python where Windtunnel theory was concidered to reduce the amount of uncertanities in the data.

A report whith graphs was produced describing the results from the windtunnel lab.
